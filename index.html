                <h3>A dream without ambition is like a car without gas... you're not going anywhere. </h3>
                <p>When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Imagine a Life without a Car</h3>
                <p>Right now, if you live in places without exceptionally good public transportation, it's very difficult to manage without a car. Yet when you think about it, for most people owning a car is quite wasteful. It'\s an expensive item of equipment that sits idle most of the time; it requires parking (and often a parking structure) both at origin and at destination; it requires maintenance and is a big hassle all around.</p>

                <p>So reliable, quick-response chauffeur services could free many people from the need to tie up all those resources in a consumer durable that they only use now and then. And from a social point of view it would avoid the need to tie up so much capital that sits unused most of the time.</p>

                <p>There is, however, an obvious problem: rush hour. Peak car use comes twice a day, and that would seem to dictate that we have nearly as many cars as we do now even if they’re supplied by the likes of Uber.</p>

                <p>But here’s where surge pricing comes in. If traveling during peak hours is more expensive than off-peak, people will have an incentive to shave off those peaks. People who aren’t commuting to work will avoid travel at peak hours; some people will find other ways to travel; some people (and businesses) will rearrange their schedules to take advantage of cheaper off-peak travel. So you can imagine a society that still relies mainly on cars to get around, but manages to do this with significantly fewer cars than we need at present.</p>

                <p>Cars aren’t the only consumer durable where something like this might work, of course. People in New York don’t need refrigerators (and in particular freezers) that are as big as those in the suburbs, because it’s so easy to pop around the corner for groceries; online ordering and delivery could produce a similar effect outside the city. But cars are surely the big prize.</p>

                 <h3>Tips on Buying a Car</h3>
                 <p>
                1. If you're in no rush to buy a car, the end of a model year is a great time to get a deal. Determining when this is for a particular car can be difficult, but if a dealer has two years of a new vehicle on its lot (say, 2014s and 2015s), chances are the older ones are going to be priced to move. The last week of the year is another good time to buy. You'll find lots of specials and manufacturer incentives at both times of year.</p>
                <p>
                2. If you're looking to get information on a car or talk about a deal, but you aren't quite ready to buy, a weekday afternoon is a great time to go visit a dealership. You'll get more personal attention than you would on a busy weekend.</p>
                <p>
                3. Don't be afraid to listen to dealership suggestions. I'm not talking about bait and switch, but salespeople offering really good alternatives. When I sold cars, it was common for people to come looking for a particular model because of its low sticker price, but then drive out with a nicer car at the same or a lower price, thanks to the special programs and incentives that they didn't know existed.</p>
