                         Get the answers you need from ASE, the industry expert in vehicle repair.</p>

                    <p>The most common question we hear from consumers is, “What do I need to do to take care of my car and avoid big repair bills?”</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, the answer is simple: Establish and follow a regular vehicle maintenance plan. A maintenance plan is essential for protecting your automotive investment and maximizing the reliability and safety of your vehicle.</p>

                    <p>Start with reading your vehicle owner’s manual, where you’ll find the automaker’s recommendations and maintenance schedules based on your driving patterns and habits.</p>

                    <p>Next, you’ll need to find a good repair shop. Whether a shop is connected to a new car dealership, part of a national chain or an independent service provider, the most important thing to look for is whether they have ASE-certified
                         technicians on staff.</p>

                    <p>You’ll also need to know how to communicate properly and effectively to avoid misunderstandings that can increase repair and diagnostic costs. <a href="http://www.ase.com/News-Events/Publications/Car-Care-Articles.aspx" type="_blank">contnue reading</a></p>
